# Notes: 
While Kaggle datasets often have some limitations, such as unguaranteed accuracy and lack of detailed information about the data source, they remain a valuable resource for me to learn and practice data analysis skills.

In this project, I will use a Kaggle dataset to practice fundamental data analysis techniques, including regression modeling, classification, and clustering. I will perform data cleaning techniques to remove missing or skewed values. I will also perform sensitivity analysis techniques to assess the impact of data changes on my analysis results.

I believe that using a Kaggle dataset will help me develop the data analysis skills necessary to succeed in the field of data analysis.
